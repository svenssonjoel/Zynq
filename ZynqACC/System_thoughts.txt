System thoughts
----------------------

- Kernel generation?
  - Is it possible to pregenerate a minimal set of kernels that can all be programmed
    onto the FPGA at once?
  - Is it possible to have a set of bit-files and switch between these
    if option one is impossible?
  - Pregeneration of specialized bit-files per application.
  - Generate OpenCL, or C? (Maybe C) 
  - Is it possible to generate any supporting infrastructure? (scheduler??)
  - Kernel optimisation and fusion 

- Hardware generation automation
  - Generate TCL and take the VIVADO GUI out of the loop 

- Runtime considerations?
  - Shared FPGA between applications, how ?? 

- Safety/security angle?
  - Can LTZvisor be used in this context?
  - Usage of FPGA resources from both partitions in an MCS, is this possible?
    - Guarantees of isolation in this case? (if the non-critical partition gets control of the
      FPGA, it may have total view of memory).

- Example applications:
  - Image processing
    - Edge detection
  - what else?  

- Demonstrator?
