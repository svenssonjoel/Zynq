Components
----------------

Dimensionality and sizes:
- 1,2 and 3D arrays
- Arrays have finite length


Array creation:
- const_array
- iota 

Map:
- map
- multiple different zipWith
- map with index: imap
- zipWith with index: iZipWith ?
    -- imap, izipwith easily implemented with iota and basic zipwith. 

Reduction:
- Different kinds of reductions for arrays of different dimensions 

Filtering:


Scan:

Stencil operations:

Supported data elements:
- Base types: Int32, Int64, Float, Double, Bool etc
- Structure of arrays will be the only option for composite data types
